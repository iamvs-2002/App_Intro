# App_Intro

App intro helps the user to understand why he is using the application and how this app will benefit him. This will increase the user engagement to your application. Furthermore, it also increases the user experience with your application.

### This project is an implementation of a Welcome Screen for the new users.
- In this application, welcome screen has been created using ViewPager. 
- The user can slide through the different screens that tell the features of the application. 
- The welcome screen should be shown only once when the app is launched for the very first time. 
- If the user launches the app a second time, he should directly go to the main screen. 
- To achieve this, SharedPreferences have been used to store a boolean value indicating first time launch.

#### The video below shows the working of the app:
